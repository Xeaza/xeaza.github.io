title: Happy New Year!
---

New Year. New website. I've had a lot going on recently. I graduated from [Mobile Makers Academy](mobilemakers.co)in Chicago, IL. What an amazing experience. I learned so much! Since I've been back on on the east coast, I've been expanding on all the learning I did while in Chicago. I'm also looking for full-time work as an [iOS developer](http://www.taylorwrightsanson.com/images/Wright-Sanson%20Taylor%20Resume.pdf). Know of something? Shoot me an [email](mailto:taylorwrightasnson@gmail.com). 

I'm using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)for this new site. The look and feel is very similar to my old site, only I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)for my blog platform. It took me a little while to teach myself how to navigate the structure and figure it out but now that I've got it down it's great. Jekyll makes blogging nice and easy. All I have to do is write this post in markdown and save it in my site's _posts folder. Push to Github and it's up and running. 

For developing the site Jekyll is great as well. To run Jekyll's built in development server just run the command  `$ jekyll serve` in the directory of your site. The server will run at `http://localhost:4000/`. This is great for previewing changes before you make them live. 

I'm going to use this blog as a place to share projects I'm working on, tips I might have and the occasional haiku.
