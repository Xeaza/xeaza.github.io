Thanks for stopping by. My name is Taylor Wright-Sanson. I wear many hats. You’ll be able to find out about a few of them here. My degree is in Computer Science and Interface Design, from Wheaton College in MA. I love designing and developing websites and iPhone apps and for the right price I’ll do it all while riding a unicycle.

Hire me! I’m passionate about creating things that work well and look beautiful. Hard work and I have been friends since I was introduced to my first snow shovel age 4. Traveling with a circus troupe during my formative teen years has helped shape me into a vital and fun team player. Performing for thousands has taught me grace under pressure and the role of risk in accomplishment.
