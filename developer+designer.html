	        <p>Alien Digest is a fun way to get your fix of reddit. A clean interface delivers daily digests of top content from your top subreddits at 8am and 6pm. You can refresh content at any time. The app also gets to know you and will suggest subreddits to check out based on your interests or location. Up vote, down vote, read comments, and stay engaged with the Reddit community on the go.</p>
	       	<p>Alien Digest was created by myself, Richmond Watkins and Christopher Ruggles as our capstone project at the Mobile Makers Academy in Chicago, Il.</p>
			<p>In just three weeks, we crammed as much as we possibly could into our app. I don't mean we filled the app with features for features sake. Don't get me wrong, our app has features, plenty of them. We streamlined our design to create a sleek, clean viewing experience all while including features that we feel will enhance your Alien Digest experience.</p>
			<p>Some of the coolest stuff is all happening behind the scenes. Twice a day you get your digest. Everyday, 10 minutes before 8am and 6pm (in any timezone) our server silently alerts Alien Digest to wake up in the background and go out to reddit to request the latest top posts from the subreddits you've subscribed to. Once our app gets those posts it saves them in Core Data. Then, on the hour of 8am or 6pm respectively, we send a push notification alerting our users that their digest is ready. You open the app and bam, there are all your new posts ready to do with zero load time. How about that for handy?</p>
			<p>We've added some cleaver ways to up/down vote on posts if you like them or not. You can even share posts. Check out the comments for each post we digest those two. The interaction with comments is all custom for our app (the way you can show/hide comments). </p>
			<p>We think Alien Digest will provide you with a great bite of reddit that you can digest all before work and when you get home. Alien Digest is a work in progress. If you have comments or suggestions we'd love to hear about them at reddit.com/r/aliendigest</p>

	        <p>The Circus Smirkus app gives you the most up to date information on the current tour, news and videos. You can get directions to any site as well as buy tickets, add reminders to your calendar and see where the tour is whenever you're looking.</p>
			<p>I am currently rewriting the Smirkus app from scratch using my newfound skills from the Mobile Makers Academy in Chicago, IL. Version 3.0 is sleek and fast. Using Core Data, blocks and plenty of async calls I keep the app up to date with the most important content available even offline. Using view animations I'm creating some fun transitions to the details of each site.</p>

	        <h4>Pocket Memos is an easy to use, intuitive recording app</h4>

			<p>I created Pocket Memos with ease of use in mind. I was tired of all the other recording apps out there that complicate the true purpose of their apps, with poorly designed layouts and unnecessary choices.</p>

			<p>From the moment you open Pocket Memos it is clear how to use it and what it does. If you're interested in more than the basic options, they are available but they won't ever get in your way.</p>

			<p>I created and maintain this app as a way to learn how to use Core Audio for iOS as well has how to connect to services such as Dropbox (Evernote is in the works). With Pocket Memos you can create recordings, upload them to dropbox and email them to your friends.</p>
